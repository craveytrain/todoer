# Next steps

1. deploy to netlify and measure performance
2. attempt to go directly to faunadb via GraphQL query rather than through FaaS

Inspirations:
- Simplest way to use Apollo with Gatsby: https://github.com/jlengstorf/gatsby-with-apollo
- Works with netlify: https://github.com/piducancore/gatsby-starter-apollo-netlify
  - Uses netlify dev, not sure how I feel about that
